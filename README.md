Welcome to the **Basket Challenge** — a technical game development challenge focused on recreating the core gameplay loop of Miniclip's mobile game [*Basketball Stars*](https://www.miniclip.com/games/basketball-stars).

## Objective

- Swipe-based shooting mechanics
- Ball physics and trajectories
- Basic scoring system:
  - 3 points for perfect shots
  - 2 points for standard shots
- Backboard bonus:
  - Occasionally the backboard blinks — touching it before scoring grants bonus points (4, 6, or 8)
- Fireball bonus:
  - Successful shots fill a meter
  - Once full, your ball ignites and you score double points
  - Fireball lasts for a short time or until a missed shot
- AI-controlled opponent that competes against the player using the same shooting mechanics 
- Custom match mode (Custum difficulty and match duration)
